## My Solutions to Problems of The Elements of Statistical Learning
I am solving problems of the book The Elements of Statistical Learning by Profs. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. Initially I'll be solving problems required as homeworks for my course STAT 195 (Statistical Machine Learning) at Harvard University. However gradually I intend to solve as many problems as I can from the book.

Below I list out the problems which I have uploaded thus far.
