## My Solutions to Problems of The Elements of Statistical Learning
This repo contains my solutions to select problems of the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Profs. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. See the table below for the list of problems I have solved thus far:

|Filename     |Problems Covered     |
|-------------|---------------------|
|Pset 1.pdf   |2.2-2.5, 2.7, 2.9    |

Initially I'll solve problems required as homeworks for my course STAT 195 (Statistical Machine Learning) at Harvard University. I gradually intend to solve as many problems as I can from the book.

The authors have kindly made the book freely available for download at [this link](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).
