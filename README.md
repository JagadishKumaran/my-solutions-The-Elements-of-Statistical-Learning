## My Solutions to Problems of The Elements of Statistical Learning
This repo contains my solutions to select problems of the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Profs. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. Initially I'll be solving problems required as homeworks for my course STAT 195 (Statistical Machine Learning) at Harvard University. However gradually I intend to solve as many problems as I can from the book.

The authors have kindly made the book freely available for download at [this link](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf).

Below is a list of problems which I have uploaded thus far.

|Filename     |Problems Covered     |
